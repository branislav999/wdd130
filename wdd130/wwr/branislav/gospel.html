                "And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come." -3 Nephi 11:15

                Many Nephites gathered at the temple in Bountiful. They were amazed at the great changes in the land. The people were talking about Jesus Christ and the sign of his death. While they were talking, they heard a quiet voice from heaven. It made their hearts burn. At first they did not understand the voice, but when it spoke the third time, they understood it. The voice was Heavenly Fatherâ€™s. It introduced Jesus Christ and told the people to listen to him. Jesus Christ came down from heaven and stood among the people. They were afraid to speak because they did not understand what was happening. They thought Jesus was an angel. He told them he was Jesus Christ, the one the prophets had said would come. Jesus told the people to come and feel the marks in his side and in his hands and feet, where he had been nailed to the cross. Jesus wanted the people to know that he was their God and that he had died for their sins. As they felt the marks in his hands and feet, the people knew he was the Savior. Then the people praised Jesus and fell at his feet and worshiped him. He then taught them great teachings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that anyone can find in the Book of Mormon.
